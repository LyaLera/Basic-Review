## Lists
You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one. 
 
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Google]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://google.com)).
My favorite search engine is [Google](https://google.com).
